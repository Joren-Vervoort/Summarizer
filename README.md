# Text summarization

- Type of challenge: Learning
- Duration: `2 weeks`
- Deadline : `07/05/2021 09:00 AM`
- Contributors: Joren Vervoort

## Mission objectives

- Use of tokenization, stemming and lemmatization for exploration of text-based datasets.
- Explore state-of-the-art algorithms for text summarization.
- Use of transformers.
- Evaluate the performance of pre-trained models.
- Development and deployment of the dashboard for text summarization.

## The Mission

A book publishing company is interested in increasing its online sales. The marketing department discovered the way people read is evolving and now rather than reading the full book, people prefer to get an overview of the main ideas expressed by the author. The digital era also means that customers want to get answers not from one book but from thousands immediately.

You have the task of developing an "AI-powered tool" able to "read" the content of any given book and make a summarization of the text. Also, the tool has to be deployed online since the company is looking to integrate the program into their website and connect it with the database where the books are stored.
